    <string name="about_section_1_para_1">Users can navigate and interact with their Android device using a physical keyboard, rather than touching the screen. Your app should allow keyboard users to perform all the actions that are possible using touch.</string>
    <string name="about_section_1_para_2">When navigating with a keyboard, all interactable elements should be focusable. Note, this is different to navigating with a screen reader, which should also focus for example on text elements in order to read them out.</string>
    <string name="about_section_2_title">How to test your app using a keyboard to navigate?</string>
    <string name="about_section_2_para_1">With your app running in an emulator in Android Studio you can simply press the tab key to move focus to the next element. Press enter to interact with the currently focused element. You can also navigate the screen using the arrow keys.</string>
