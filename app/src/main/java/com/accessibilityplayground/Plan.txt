The overall idea is to make an app that demonstrates and allows you to test and implement various
accessibility features.

Home Screen - not neccessary but could be a good exercise to summarise, create widgets, or link to
articles or something

Side bar to navigate between different screens

screens:
- Keyboard input
    - demonstrate showing visible focus
    - demonstrate default behaviour
    - explain what is keyboard input and how to test it
