# Accessibility Playground App

The overall idea of this project is to demonstrate how to build accessible Android apps. 

It is an opportunity for me to implement ideas that I have learned about but not yet tried, to build something of my own, and to be able to share this knowledge with others.

I aim to provide tips and information to help you learn about and be able to test various accessibility features, as well as showing how they can be implemented in the code.

So far the first section is about Keyboard Access, implementing a few different examples of what I learned about keyboard focus from Eeva-Jonna Panula's [blog](https://eevis.codes/blog/2025-07-07/its-all-about-accessibility-focus-and-compose/) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou-mws7GX_A) at DroidCon Berlin.

The below video demonstrates navigating a screen with several collapsible sections by keyboard. One section demonstrates the default focus visibility and order of a grid of buttons. The next two sections show the focused buttons with a more visible focus indicator, a border or a change in colour. The last section shows a different focus order to the default.

Ideas for what to cover next:
- top bars with long titles (https://github.com/GuessWh0o/AccessibleTopBars)
- supporting different font sizes
- color contrast ratios
- screen readers - focus order, content descriptions, roles, state descriptions
- voice access
- home screen - summarise info, create widgets, link to articles?
